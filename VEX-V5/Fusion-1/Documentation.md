Fusion was designed with the goal of picking up and moving mobile goals as optimally as possible. With the forklift apparatus at the front, Fusion is capable of quickly lifting mobile goals off the ground and putting them on top of the tipping point. Additionally, the robot has a clip at the back that allows it to drag around a second base. The design is meant for a quick in-and-out strategy, where the driver steals mobile goals from the opposing team in order to score them.
