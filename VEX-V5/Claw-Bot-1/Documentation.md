Clawbot was made to have a simple and versatile system. The robot's arm has the ability to reach both near and far objects, seeing as it has both a "shoulder" and "elbow" that move individually. The claw at the end of the arm has a shape which allows it to both hook on to goals and pick up rings with ease.
