Scorpio was designed with the goal of optimizing the collection of rings while simultaneously moving around mobile goals efficiently. Its conveyor belt system allows it to quickly and efficiently pick up many rings in quick succession while also depositing them into a mobile goal. This goal is held up by the two mechanisms at the rear of the robot which hold the base steady from both the bottom and the top. The final piece of Scorpio's ring collection is its guiding ramp, located at the top of the conveyor belt, which allows the rings to fall onto the branch on the alliance mobile goal with more accuracy. Additionally, it has a forklift at the front which allows it to quickly pick up and move around mobile goals.
